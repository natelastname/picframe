# Introduction

`picframe` is a Python package for putting frames around images. It
is inspired by an old script with similar functionality by Fred
Weinhaus (see: [link](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/picframe/index.php).) `picframe` can be invoked from the command
line, or in python code by importing the package as a python module.

For example usage, see [run.py](run.py) (which is the script used to generate
the following images.)


# Features

-   Comes with 12 **amazing** built-in frames (which are also called *mouldings*)
-   The ability to specify thickness and color of the matting and decorative border
-   Customizable drop shadow for added realism
