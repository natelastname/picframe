* Introduction

=picframe= is a Python package for putting frames around images. It
is inspired by an old script with similar functionality by Fred
Weinhaus (see: [[http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/picframe/index.php][link]].) =picframe= can be invoked from the command
line, or in python code by importing the package as a python module.

For example usage, see [[file:run.py][run.py]] (which is the script used to generate
the following images.)

* Features

- Comes with 12 *amazing* built-in frames (which are also called /mouldings/)
- The ability to specify thickness and color of the matting and decorative border
- Customizable drop shadow for added realism
